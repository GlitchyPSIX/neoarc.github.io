# How the spriteEditor works and how can i download it.

## Download and setup:
- In the #resource-sprite from the pinned messages, download the latest version and then move it into your Mario Multiverse folder next to `Mario.exe`.
You can open this here, then use the open button to open the `.sprite` files, or you can associate the `.sprite` files with spriteEditor and open the .sprite file directly.

- You can rearrange the windows by grabbing the top of the window border and start dragging. In this case, small arrow icons will appear, if you drag one into it, it will attach the window to the edge of another.

## spriteEditor windows can be used for the following things:

### Preview:
- here you can see the animations and sprites with the correct offset.
- The horizontal black line is the ground and the vertical is the center.
### Properties:
- This is where the properties of things appear if you click on it.
### Animations:
- If you click on one, the animation with the correct offset will appear in the `preview` windows.
- You can also create your own animation but they names cannot be anything most of the time. Each has its own name, such as `AirSpin` etc...
- If you click on one of them, its properties will appear in the `properties` window. There you can set which frame to start from (FirstFrame) and how many frames can go until it repeats (FrameCount). Here you can also set the delay between frames (-1 is the default).
### Sprite frames:
- If you click on one of them, it will appear in the `preview` window with the correct offset and its properties will appear in the properties window. 
- Here you can set the area where the sprite is, but this happens automatically when you double click on it.
- You can also set the offset here, but this is easier with the small arrow icons in the Home tab. With the offset you can shift the sprite from the center of the hitbox on the x and y coordinate.

## hotkeys:
- CTRL + MouseWheel: Zoom
- W, A, D, X key: Move offset

## Fin.
- That’s not all, but other things might be easier to figure out if you try things you don’t know, because that’s one of the best way to learn.
- If something is still not clear, DM to author (Marci599#6969) on discord and I will try to help.
