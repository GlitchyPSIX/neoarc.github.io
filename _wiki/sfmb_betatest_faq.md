# Under construction

#### Q. Why wonâ€™t SFMB start up after a computer reboot?

- Make sure Discord app is open.
- Since the game uses it to verify your account on startup.

#### Q. Can you download SFMB on multiple computers?
(For example your pc and your laptop?)

- Yes, there is no limit.

#### Q: Can you play SFMB on Linux System?

- Basically, no.
- But I think you can run with WINE.

#### Q: What do I do if I delete a SFMB file by accident?

1. [Click this](sfmb://forceupdate), this will let you download missing file.
1. If you deleted core file such as `Mario.exe`, then force-update won't work.
	- Then run `MarioDownloader` the bot sent you. 
	- It will re-download missing files that you (or windows defender) deleted.
