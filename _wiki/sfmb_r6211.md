# MarioArcade update

## Change note

the MA update just finished, these are all the things that the update brings
- Effects: Fixed texture errors
- Background: Adapted the new color palette, and redesigned some decorations.
- Bullet: Adapted the new color palette and replaced some designs.
- DesingPalete: Updated and added the current MM news.
- Enemy: The color palette was adapted to all the Enemy's according to the environment of their respective world, the new enemies were added and several errors in the .sprite were corrected (some enemies suffered a slight change of design due to the new palette).
- Frabackground: Adapted the new color palette to most of the backgrounds (some of them were completely redesigned thanks to this). 
- Helmet: Adapted the new color palette and slightly changed the design.
- Hud: Adapted the new color palette and improved several textures.
- Item: The new color palette was adapted according to the atmosphere of each world, the boomerang item was added, and the design of the hearts was changed.
- Luigi: All his available transformations are adapted to the new color palette, lots of errors were corrected in the .sprite with respect to the helmets he can use.
- Mario: All the current transformations that MM has can be used by this Mario, all adapted to the new color palette. Also a lot of errors were corrected with respect to the helmets.
- MapObject: In general lines the colors of MapObject were improved for all the worlds (it is no longer so disastrous), several objects were redesigned, and some others were adapted to the new color palette (not all).
- NPC: The new color palette was adapted to the characters according to the setting of each world (except for the poster, so it is not 100%).
- ThemeIcon: Changed the design
- Tilesets: Adapted the new color palette to most of the tilesets, several things were redesigned, especially the semi-platforms of several worlds.
HardBrick: Changed its design for all worlds, now has a better look so you can get more out of it.
- Vehicles: Adapted the new color palette.
- Toad: I noticed that someone had created some transformations of Toad for MA, I adapted him to the current palette and now he can be playable (obviously, not with all the available transformations, like Luigi)
What's new
- Almost all customthemes were redesigned to have a better look than before
- Added a new customtheme (Magma)
- A color palette was created for MA, from which any object must follow the use of this specific palette.
- All new missing items were added to be available in MA, and old ones were redesigned (The only thing I couldn't do was the LiquidLayer) 
- All worlds now have their own soundtracks (except Troll Mode), being all retro music, except 3 in particular due to their unrelated theme to traditional MA worlds.
- Several worlds were renamed
- The music of the Airship world was changed

(and other things that I don't remember anymore)

## Creator's message

Originally I had cancelled it, but due to the insistence of the people I decided to continue it, it is not 100%, I had several plans that in the end I did not carry them out, so the update is incomplete. I estimate that of the 100% only 60% of what I had in mind is in this update. I can not continue with MA, I have been working on this update since 2019 and at the moment I do not have time to be making sprites due to my studies. The change before and after this update is abysmal, I'm sure many people will like it. Inside the theme I put a text document where you can find all the things I had planned to do for MA, of course, in case someone else wants to do the things I missed
