# Summary
- This wiki explains how to make parallax backgrounds using Theme version 2, since many of you haven't heard of it, there are plenty of options in theme version 2, such as: auto scroll background, custom scroll ratio, infinite custom sky color and background object, animated background, etc.... This wiki doesn't include all of these, but you can easily figure it out for yourself. I hope it helps!  

# 1. Preparing files
1. File names must begin with a Layer and end with a number. *eg.* `LayerOverworld1`
2. Copy a `.sprite` file from somewhere, *eg.* `Resources\GameThemes\SMAS\Sprite\LayerOverworldSky.sprite`.
	- Each layer png must have a `.sprite` file with the same name as png.

# 2. Sprite editor
1. Open the one you want to start with. *eg.* `LayerOverworld1.sprite`
2. If everything right, you need to see the picture in the SpriteEditor.

3. Click the first sprite frame.
4. Double click on the image.
	- Make sure the entire image is selected.

5. Rewrite the offset to `0`.

6. Delete the animation if it exists. (you only need it if you want to animate)
	- ![5](/post-img/wiki/sfmb_betatest_how_to_make_parallax_background/109678521-0dc5c680-7bbe-11eb-89e5-641f80611c49.png)
8. Do the same with the others.
	- However, the clouds on the png. should also be as high as in the game *eg.* `NSMBWii`. **Or** push it up with the .sprite offset.

# 3. Map editor
1. Press the **Manage GameThemes** button in the mapeditor.
	- ![7](/post-img/wiki/sfmb_betatest_how_to_make_parallax_background/109678518-0d2d3000-7bbe-11eb-8af8-74484d40bd37.png)
2. You need to set the `Theme Version` to **2**
	- You can only rewrite if you have permission for the theme or itâ€™s a custom theme.

3. Press the **Edit ThemeDefinitions**.
4. Press **Background Layer**. 
5. You need to enter the file names here without the word: layer. *eg:* `overworld1`.
	- ![9](/post-img/wiki/sfmb_betatest_how_to_make_parallax_background/109678506-0acad600-7bbe-11eb-9336-ffb279060458.png)
	- Just a few tips:
		1.  If you are making a parallax background, I recommend setting most layers to `bottom` and if possible, set the clouds and underground parts to `bottom & repeat`. If you are doing it well, it will look the most natural.		
		2. I also recommend that you have a separate sky layer that is just as high as the game window and set to `top and bottom`, or clear the sky color from the picture and set a custom sky color in the editor because the color of the sky will change with wind and rain

		4. But this is just my(author, not wiki owner) opinion, surely it can be solved differently to look nice, this must be experienced.
6. Adjust the scroll ratio around as it is in the original game, or as you like.

7. Now you have to enter the same names for the layers in order (the first one is at the back) separated with commas without spaces.

# FarBackground
- If you make a parallax background or animated background, you don't need FarBackground.

# Fin.
1. But these are also just the basics, there are still plenty of options in `Theme Version 2`.
2. If something is not understandable, DM to author(Marci599#6148), and if I available I will try to help.
