# About

* The map editor is familiar to some, but very unfamiliar to others. This is especially true for those who are familiar with game-style UIs such as Mario Maker.
* Those familiar with Visual Studio, Microsoft Office, or Lunar Magic will find the map editor of this game familiar. Initially, the program was designed to be used by adults who are familiar with computers rather than children as young as 5 years old. ~~just because i made it for my use.~~

# Guide

* **Johanna** (Beta tester/Discord user) wrote MapEditor guide for beginners in July 2022.
* The guide is a pdf document, and it is written as a descriptive document with some screenshots attached. You will probably get the feeling of getting her 1:1 coaching from her.
* I would like to thank her. üòÅ
