>I like the community - we have a lot of cool level creators with ideas that can inspire other people to make new content/sprites/etc with a developer who obviously really likes making the game better.

>The big thing that sicks out for me is just how versatile and simple the level editor is. Barely any object limits or hard-coded barriers are in the way while build, allowing me to build larger, longer, and more creative levels.    
>PixelArtX is also one of the most versatile and easy-to-use objects in any Mario level editor I've played. They help a ton with visuals, making a level more visually distinct than they would be otherwise.    
>I also have to give my praises to the spriters and musicians who worked on the SMB, SMB2, and SMB3 themes, they all did an awesome job with them! (even if I don't like my own contributions for SMB3's music all that much)

>Not that it will stay this way forever, but the community size is good, too! Contributors kind of know each other and even those of us that mostly play the game... like when playing a level, you can kinda get a sense for what to expect based on who made it  because the list of creators is fairly limited versus other games where it's just a bunch of nameless people I've never heard of ðŸ˜„ like when I start a @Pixelcraftian level I know I'm in for something interesting and I get a little stressed out  ðŸ˜‚    
>I also like the dedication to stage modding - it definitely makes a massive difference

>I really love the music in this game, I think that is what sold it for me. Having so many game styles is also nice. Another thing I like is the community, there are enough active people and level makers here that the server feels full, but not so many that it is flooded. Plus seeing people you know upload a level is far more common, and while there might be less levels at times it's still pretty neat.

>definitely quality over quantity - I'll take a few thousand great levels versus hundreds of thousands of powerup spam

>The game has a lot of expression of allowing itâ€™s parts to be mixed and matched. The controls are nice, and the kinds of levels that you can make here are unique to only this game. At its core it has a lot of unique core mechanics and interactions that lead to great platforming.   

>I like the variety of looks, colors, music. MM2 doesnâ€™t have nearly enough visual expression, despite its more polished gameplay and greater access to parts. There is a way for every level to be 100% unique, and despite the incomplete themes I like the variety in gameplay. I mute MM2 because it wonâ€™t let me mix and match music and it always feels the same. The way a level looks really matters to me. Having more theme options in one incomplete theme than MM2s 10 themes per style (with forced gimmicks and music box for nights) really blows it away for me.    

>In the end I also feel welcome in the community, and if the gameplay ever gets the potential for really complicated item play and even more customization with colors or weather or fog etc etc I have no reason to ever go back

```
Zap â€” 2022.02.04.
```
>I agree, I like the more focus on visual style this game has vs the "every theme needs a gimmick" process that Mario Maker 2 does. There are some downsides to that such as reading the ability flag for each level, since with MM2 you just know based on the game style.

```
Adv_Trash â€” 2022.02.04.
```
>I think the 10 seconds of ability reading required is definitely worth it for the creator to have even less restrictions. I only really wish I could decorate with slopes and change palette colors on tile sets

```
Zap â€” 2022.02.04.
```
>Pixel art can (kinda) make that possible, but it's SUPER tedious. My newest level had 2 pixel art towers with custom tile sets and it was a LOT of copy pasting.

>Itâ€™s how I made my Mega Man stage too, I do love that I can just do that

>it's a overall fun experience in both by playing and creating stages, the tools the editor gives a chance to experiment to try and mix things to have in most of times a consistent result

>i love how efficient and friendly the level editor is, even if it has some jank    
>also really like how much stuff you can customize on your level, cuz it lets you make your levels feel different from every other    
>also this game is 16:9 which instantly makes it better than some other mario editor fangames

>To me, even the unpolished features are just very exciting. The prospect of what youâ€™re cooking up in alpha, and the potential of what you continue to add to the game. I am a huge fan of it, for sure. I am excited about your continued development, the expansion of artists/musicians that are adding their work. The recent patches with the controllers really had me very excited because I felt like I was watching a lot of people work together and compile features, content, and bug fixes all at once.    
>I could go on and on honestly

ItsNotLuvin â€” 2022.02.04.

>I'm waiting the custom enemy and object that's coming to the beta, even tho I already have alpha it would be a good thing to see people make stuff with it

>The fact that this game has active support is amazing. As polished as SMM2 is, it never saw the light of day outside 2 updates. It's so cool to see all these ideas come to life here

>One of the reasons why I like this game is because it involves a lot of collaboration. People are constantly working together, whether it's new sprites, new music, or even just finding bugs. Watching those things get implemented into the game gives a very fulfilling sense of progression. And finding out that a bug was fixed is also a nice feeling, whether it was a major or minor bug.

>Well.. No 1 Mario Fan Game. No 1 Fan Game Developer. This game is fabulous, no doubt.    

>Best part is the editor and variety of game styles and themes.    

>Coolest thing is, it is in active development and user feedback is heard with priority    

>And, most of you already know how far I went to get this game

>mario multiverse is by far the BEST super mario fangame ever, the controls and physics are nice, the editor is super good for making levels easily, the pixelart feature just adds so much opportunities to the table, the community is awesome, ability flags are one of the best features, and the amount of themes are just incredible

```

>I love how user friendly yet extensive the editor is. PixelArtX also helps  making a unique level reasonably simple with way more options than SMM2 but without the hassle that is Lunar Magic. It's the best of both worlds right now and I think expanding even further on editor features would make this game even better. I also like the limited amount of members in the community, as it means it's easier to ensure improving the game since mostly dedicated people join.

```
ProneSlone â€” 2022.02.05.

>Personally, the best part about this game is the Editor. It's incredibly User-Friendly and it's very enjoyable to make levels and come up with stuff to do, especially some of the blocks and objects to work with, PixelArtX especially. The wide range of objects as well keeps things fresh and makes level creators almost never run of ideas.    
>Speaking of levels another great part is the quality of most of the levels found in stage world, making playing levels fun and enjoyable. something which cannot be said for a majority of levels found in SMM2.

>Community is another great thing about this game, ensuring growth and prosperity from spriting, music, level creating and just general chat making this game welcoming and a joy to be in.

>I played almost any Mario game there is on the Game Boy (Advance), (3)DS, (S)NES, N64, GCN, Wii(U) and now the Switch. To relive these old memories all in one big package, bringing old and new game mechanics together, is so nostalgic and awesome beyond believe. The best part is that my son enjoys watching me playing your game, too, so a win/win for us both ðŸ˜‰

Johanna â€” 2022.02.06.

>The sheer diversity in game styles and themes is just overwhelmingly cool, plus the Editor is pretty powerful and lets you do a lot of things too. There isn't much that isn't possible compared to other fan-editors or even official software like Mario Maker and Mario Maker 2. I think the next best step to take would be to add more items, enemies and things to the editor.

>I like how this game has some elements that the switch mario maker doesn't and the editor itself is very basic and good    
>I like how the online levels are free and no one forces you to get the subscription for them    
>I love the amount of styles and creativity people put into levels

>It's so powerful, yet easy to use.    
>The freedom in this game is so refreshing after feeling like I was caged in SMM1&2

>There are a great number of reasons that I love Mario Multiverse:    
     â€¢ I love to create levels    
     â€¢ I love to play Mario    
     â€¢ Many different styles and level themes to choose from    
     â€¢ A slow but steady release of new content (themes, items, enemies)    
     â€¢ A small, curated community that creates mostly excellent content    
     â€¢ A community involved in the brainstorming of development    
     â€¢ Community contribution in terms of graphics/music

>idk if this is too late, but I like this game soo much is I had a great time playing it. There are a lot of game themes, the map editor is easy to use. The fact that it has a server that lets u download, play and upload levels is the best. A lot of other fan games doesn't have a server. Best fan game ever.

>I like this game because the editor is way more powerful than mario maker but still easy to use, the variety of all the level themes makes SMFB stand out from other fan games too.    

>The community also helps a lot, the fact that it's very small contributes to the quality of levels in general and it personnally connects me more to the community than the bigger games where i don't feel the same.    

>also the game is fun
